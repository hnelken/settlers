SETTLERS OF CATAN / PIONEERS OF TATTOOINE

To run the program, execute the file "Main.java" and pass it the names of the 3 or 4 players that will play the game. Click around and see if you can advance the game, as the visual aspect is not very informative despite there being a mass of code behind what doesn't seem like much of a product.

Functionality is comprehensive, though visual cues are almost entirely lacking. You could call it a mystery game.
